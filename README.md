# Health Check Tool

Welcome! If you’re here, you’re either exploring automation projects or checking out my profile for a potential collaboration. This project is designed to showcase a simple yet effective automated health check tool using Ansible and Jenkins. It periodically monitors server health, generates reports, and sends alerts in case of any issues.

## Features
- Automated health checks for CPU, memory, and disk usage.
- Scheduled execution using Jenkins.
- Generates and archives health check reports.
- Sends email alerts if any health checks fail.

```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository.**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/health-check-tool.git
   ```

2. **Configure Jenkins to pull from this repository and run the `health_check.yml` playbook.**
   - Set up a Jenkins job that runs the Ansible playbook as a build step.
   - Ensure that Jenkins has the required permissions to execute Ansible.

3. **Schedule Jenkins to run the job daily and configure email notifications.**
   - In the Jenkins job, set up a build trigger to schedule the job to run daily.
   - Configure email notifications in Jenkins to alert in case of a failure.

## Example Output
Here’s an example of the health report output generated by Ansible:

### Disk Usage:

## Screenshots


Below are screenshots that demonstrate the Health Check Tool in action.

1. **Jenkins Job Setup Screenshot**## Email Notification

This project is configured to send an email notification every 15 minutes with the status of the health check report. Below is an example of the email notification:

![Email Notification Screenshot](screenshots/email_notification.png) <!-- Add the correct path if different -->

The email includes details about the job name, build number, URL to the Jenkins job, and the result of the health check, along with an attachment for further inspection.
   This screenshot shows the configuration of the Health Check Job in Jenkins. Here, we set up the job to run the Ansible playbook and monitor system health.

2. **Console Output in Jenkins**
   After executing the Health Check Job, Jenkins provides a detailed console output. This output shows the steps of the Ansible playbook as it checks CPU, memory, and disk usage on the target server.
